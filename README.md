# The Anolis Distichus Genome Data Repository

Hi, thank you for coming to the repository to learn about how I assembled and annotated the data for the Anolis distichus genome. 

This assembly was created with PACBIO long reads from the University of Delaware Sequencing and Genotyping Center and Omni-C Hi-C Data from Doevtail Genomics and created using compute resources from Rutgers OARC Amarel Computing Cluster.

Large data files for this project can be accessed through the Harvard DataVerse at: [https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HJD8VT](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HJD8VT). Data are available at NCBI under BioProject PRJNA1200026, BioSample SAMN45894292.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at: chf29@scarletmail.rutgers.edu.

Cheers!

Cleo Falvey <3
