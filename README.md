Hi, thank you for coming to the repository to learn about how I assembled and annotated the data for the Anolis distichus genome. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at: chf29@scarletmail.rutgers.edu

Large data files for this project can be accessed through the Harvard DataVerse at: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HJD8VT

Data are available at NCBI under BioProject PRJNA1200026, BioSample SAMN45894292

Cheers!
